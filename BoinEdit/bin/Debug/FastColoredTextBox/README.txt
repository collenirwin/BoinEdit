In order to create your own version of the FastColoredTextBox control by Pavel Torgashov, you must open
FastColoredTextBox.sln with Visual Studio or a compatible C# IDE, make any changes and build. Then place
the new FastColoredTextBox.dll (contained in FastColoredTextBox\nin\Debug\) into the directory of the
BoinEdit executable file (replacing the FastColoredTextBox.dll already in there).
